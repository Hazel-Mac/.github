## What is Hazel  

Hazel is a powerful automation tool for macOS that helps you manage and organize files without manual effort. By creating custom rules, Hazel monitors folders, sorts files, and applies actions automatically, keeping your system clean and organized.  

This application integrates directly with Finder and works in the background, quietly performing tasks like moving documents, renaming files, tagging them, or even running scripts. Whether you need to organize your downloads folder, maintain a clutter-free desktop, or back up important files, Hazel takes care of it seamlessly.  

Hazel goes beyond basic file management by supporting advanced features such as automatic trash cleanup, duplicate file detection, and complex rule-based workflows. It’s perfect for users who want to save time and reduce repetitive tasks.  

With Hazel, you can also integrate third-party apps and macOS features like Automator and AppleScript, giving you even greater control over how your files are handled. This makes it an essential tool for professionals, creatives, and anyone who values a streamlined and efficient workspace.  

Using Hazel, you can automate repetitive actions like archiving old projects, organizing photos, or cleaning up your system. It’s designed to run quietly and reliably, ensuring your Mac stays tidy and optimized without constant attention.
